# The Unified Makerspace

## Introduction

The Makerspace is the hub for innovation on Clemson University’s campus. Here, students and faculty are able to come together to bring their ideas to life, without the technological limitations of such endeavors. It’s a place for individuals from all walks of life  to build prototypes, take courses, or to simply find inspiration.


## The Project

To run the MakerSsace, it’s helpful to track the machines and the individuals using them, both which enable more optimal allocation of resources. Our Capstone team built a complete management system for the MakerSpace where staff can see detailed information about users, assign maintenance tasks, and better manage equipment.


## Notes

Our team would like to thank our professors, TA's, and, most importantly, our mentors, Owen and Miller, for their unwavering support during our entire journey. We would also like to thank our sponsor Amazon Web Services and the Clemson School of Computing.
