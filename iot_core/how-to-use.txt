During Use:

Ensure that the Card Scanner is plugged in at all times the Raspberry Pi is running. Otherwise, you will need to restart the script.

Before First Use in Specific Location:

There are a couple of steps that need to be taken when setting up the Pi for the first time or moving to a new location.
  1)   Open the terminal and type:
            cd Desktop/CUmakeit_XX
       where XX is the number of the device (shown in the folder name on the desktop) [i.e. CUmakeit_01]

  2)   Decide if this device will be used for Sign In or Sign Out purposes.  Each device is equipped to handle either scenario,

  3a) If Sign In, type in the terminal
      cd SignIn

  3b) If SignOut, type in the terminal
      cd SignOut

  4) Verify that the Location is correct in the file start.sh by typing in the terminal
     nano start.sh
  and scrolling down to where there is the spot "Location: "
  Input the Location that the device will be in (THERE CANNOT BE ANY SPACES)

  When satisfied, press control + s to save the file and control + x to close out of the file.

  5) To run the script, type in the terminal
      ./start.sh



Running the Pi:
1)   Open the terminal and type:
          cd Desktop/CUmakeit_XX
     where XX is the number of the device (shown in the folder name on the desktop) [i.e. CUmakeit_01]

2)   Decide if this device will be used for Sign In or Sign Out purposes.  Each device is equipped to handle either scenario,

3a) If Sign In, type in the terminal
    cd SignIn

3b) If SignOut, type in the terminal
    cd SignOut

4) To run the script, type in the terminal
    ./start.sh
